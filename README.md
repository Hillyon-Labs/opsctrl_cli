# Opsctrl CLI

Opsctrl is an open-source command-line tool that helps DevOps and platform engineers diagnose Kubernetes pod issues quickly and intelligently using logs, events, and LLM-powered suggestions.

> This CLI is part of the **Opsctrl** platform. While the CLI is open source, the full SaaS backend offers incident memory, audit trails, Slack integrations, and team dashboards.
